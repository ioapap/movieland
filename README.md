# 🎥 MovieLand 🍿

This is a simple React application that uses the OMDb API to search for movies. Type in a movie title, and see the movies!

## Features 🎯

- Search for movies by title 🕵️
- View movie details like poster, year, etc. 🎬
- User-friendly interface for a smooth experience 🚀

## How it works 🛠️

MovieLand uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. On top of React, we're using Vite as a build tool for a faster and leaner development experience.

When you search for a movie, the app sends a request to the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com) to get movie details. It then displays these details in a user-friendly format.

## How to use 🚀

It's simple! Just type the title of the movie you're looking for into the search box, and hit Enter (or click the search icon 🧐). The app will display matching results right away!

## Deployment 🌐

The app is deployed on GitHub Pages. You can access it [here](https://ioapap.github.io/movieland/).

## Acknowledgements 👏

Thanks to the OMDb API for providing the movie data.
